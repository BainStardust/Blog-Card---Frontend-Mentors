## Overview

This was the second Frontend Mentor challenge I’ve completed, and I felt a lot more confident this time around. I had a better grasp of Flexbox and positioning, and this challenge was great for practicing the small visual tweaks needed to match a design closely. Overall, the build went smoothly without any major issues.

### My process

  1.Started by organizing the project folder and assets (images and font files).

  2.Sketched a rough layout on my Kindle E-Reader to plan the structure and semantic HTML.

  3.Wrote the HTML first, focusing on clear, semantic structure.

  4.Styled from the top down, starting with root-level styles (colors, fonts, and spacing).

  5.Used a mobile-first approach and frequently checked responsiveness while building.

  6.Made small visual adjustments to get the card as close as possible to the design.

  7.Finalized the repository and then published the solution.

### Built with

   -Semantic HTML5 markup
   -CSS custom properties
   -Flexbox
   -CSS Grid
   -Mobile-first workflow
   -Chrome DevTools
   -Chrome extension: Responsive Viewer

### What I learned

I strengthened my understanding of semantic structure and accessibility, and I’m becoming more comfortable choosing the right HTML tags for different types of content.

I also:

   -Practiced keeping accessibility in mind while building.
   -Learned more about text formatting and working with variable fonts.
   -Spent time reading documentation and references, especially:
        MDN Web Docs as my main reference.
        A couple of HTML & CSS books on my Kindle E-Reader.

### Continued development

I want to keep focusing on:

   -Building fully responsive layouts.
   -Improving accessibility in every project.
   -Getting more confident with modern CSS layout techniques (Flexbox and Grid).
   -Developing a consistent approach to structuring and organizing my HTML and CSS.

### Useful resources

    MDN Web Docs
    – My go-to reference for HTML, CSS, and web platform features.
